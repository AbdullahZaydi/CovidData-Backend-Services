I've deleted data of a few countries from the json file. So, If you want to use a new JSON file. Then, you can do that too.

To change the JSON data file, You can simply download the JSON data file from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data. Then, Simply download, Save & replace the downloaded JSON file with **covid.json** file.

You can also find the Postman Collection for documentation in the **postman_collection** folder.

I know that, There are still many flaws in this application that I could've looked at but I focused mainly on making requests as fast as I could and design the backend so it could run as fast as possible that's why I couldn't spend much time on authorization/authentication and security implementation. But I assure that I can be a lot more better than this.

I would love to hear your feedback on this. Please reach me out on my email address: abdullahzaydi8@gmail.compostman_collection folder.
